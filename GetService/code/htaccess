# A .htaccess file is a hidden file which runs on Unix servers
# and provides directives. Renaming this file to .htaccess and
# placing in your root directory _should_ enable GZip compression,
# reducing the weight of pages/scripts being served.

# Please note that all of these rules are optimizations
# and not necessary for jQTouch to work. If this causes
# any issues with your server, just remove.
