			<h2>Key Benefits of NFC</h2>
			
			<p align="justify">
				NFC provides a range of benefits to consumers and businesses, such as:
          <ul class="short star" style="margin-left:25px;">

<li><strong>Intuitive:</strong> NFC interactions require no more than a simple touch</li>
<li><strong>Versatile:</strong> NFC is ideally suited to the broadest range of industries, environments, and uses</li>
<li><strong>Open and standards-based:</strong> The underlying layers of NFC technology follow universally implemented ISO, ECMA, and ETSI standards.</li>
<li><strong>Technology-enabling:</strong> NFC facilitates fast and simple setup of wireless technologies, such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Inherently secure:</strong> NFC transmissions are short range (from a touch to a few centimeters)</li>
<li><strong>Interoperable:</strong> NFC works with existing contactless card technologies</li>
<li><strong>Security-ready:</strong> NFC has built-in capabilities to support secure applications</li>
</ul>

			</p><h2>A Day in the Life</h2>
			<p align="justify"> <img src="images/g.jpg"  class="alignright"/>
NFC technology has the power to bring new simplicity and convenience to many aspects of a typical person's daily life, as this example illustrates:
<ul class="short check" style="text-align:justify">

<li><strong>7:30 -</strong> Eric gets on a train to go to his office, using his NFC-enabled phone to tap a reader and easily open the turnstile.</li>
<li><strong>7:32 -</strong> He sees a poster announcing a free concert that evening. He touches his NFC-enabled phone to the N-Mark on the poster, which transfers the detailed information onto his phone. He reserves seats for the concert with his mobile phone, using mobile communications (e.g., SMS, internet, packet-based connections), and the complimentary tickets are sent to his mobile phone. He sends a text message to his wife to invite her to the concert and dinner.</li>
<li><strong>8:15 -</strong> When he arrives at his office, Eric touches his NFC-enabled phone to the office gate to unlock the security mechanism.</li>
<li><strong>Noon -</strong> At lunch time, he pays for his meal using one of the credit cards stored in his phone.</li>
<li><strong>13:00 -</strong> After lunch, Eric visits the office of his new business partner for a meeting. Those attending the meeting exchange electronic business cards, stored in their NFC-enabled phones, by touching their phones together.</li>
<li><strong>18:00 -</strong> Eric meets his wife and they go to the concert venue. He touches his NFC-enabled phone to a turnstile at the entrance to the venue, their reservations are confirmed, and they are admitted.</li>
<li><strong>20:00 -</strong> After the concert, they visit a shopping center, where they make a few purchases and have dinner, using their NFC-enabled phones to pay for everything.</li>
<li><strong>22:00 -</strong> When they arrive home, Eric realizes that he left his NFC-enabled phone on the train. He immediately calls the mobile network operator and makes a request to disable all active NFC services in the phone. If his phone is later found and returned to him, he will be able to reactivate these services.</li>
</ul>
