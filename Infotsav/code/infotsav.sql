For Programmers, Debugging errors may be hard to crack and this situation becomes worse when it is associated with memory locations. So, grasp the challenge to battle out your opponents. Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it. Debugging, particularly debugging of other peoples code, is a skill separate from the ability to write a new program. For this, check your skills in Debugging arena (Witch Hunt) by cracking worst known debugging errors. It will expose you to different levels of problems crept with errors.
