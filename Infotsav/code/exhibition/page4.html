&#9679;	Science in Everyday Life<br/>
&#9679;	Harnessing and Conserving Energy<br/>

Guidelines for preparation of Exhibits and Models<br/>
The importance of every sub-theme in the context of main theme and a number of
Suggestions for designing the exhibits/projects are given below. However, these ideas are only suggestive.<br/><br/>
<b>Participants are free to develop exhibits based on other related ideas of their choice.</b><br/>


<h4>Sub-Theme 1: 	Science in Everyday Life</h4>
Science has become a part of our Day to Day life. We can't imagine a day without having Science based equipments helping us in our activities.<br/>
&#9679;	Construct and explain the working of Burglar Alarm systems<br/>
&#9679;	Make models on Rain Alarms, Photocopy Machines, Vacuum Cleaners and other equipments used in our day to day activities.<br/>
&#9679;	Construct and explain the working of Rain Water Harvester and other such devices which conserve water etc.<br/>
&#9679;	Water Purification systems and other pollution control systems.<br/>
&#9679;	Use of eco-friendly and innovative devices that may help in combating climate change.<br/>

<h4>Sub-theme 2:   Harnessing and Conservation of Energy</h4>
Everything we do today requires some form of energy to function be it Petrol to run your cars or Cells and Batteries to run your Mobile Phones, Laptops etc. Finding new sources of energy whilst conserving and developing those which we already have are very important.<br/>
&#9679;	Demonstrate how to harness energy from different raw materials like Flowers, Potatoes and Lemons etc.<br/>
&#9679;	Make models and explain the working of Energy conservation utilities like Auto Switch Off of Lights and Fans when someone leaves the room etc.<br/>
&#9679;	Harness renewable sources of energy using Wind Mills, Solar Cells etc.<br/>
&#9679;	Construct and explain working of DC/AC motors etc. <br/>
&#9679;	Energy from biomass, Improved designs of biogas/biomass plant<br/>
&#9679;	Solar thermal electricity/community solar project<br/>
&#9679;	Innovative designs of solar cooker/solar distiller/solar dryer for food processing/solar heated houses.<br/>
